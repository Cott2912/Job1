    "This website is family-friendly, carefully selecting and developing games to provide a positive, age-appropriate experience.",
    "In-game payments have become commonplace in free games. This matter is easily recognized through actions such as withholding material or aggravating you in an effort to induce you to purchase power-ups in those games. It appears that the catch for playing free games is that they will use every trick to get you to payâ€”frequently many times more than you would pay for the game outright. This method is effective, and some individuals unknowingly spend enormous amounts of money on their favorite games over time. There are no in-game purchases whatsoever in any of our games. All of our games and their materials are completely free, with no exceptions!"
